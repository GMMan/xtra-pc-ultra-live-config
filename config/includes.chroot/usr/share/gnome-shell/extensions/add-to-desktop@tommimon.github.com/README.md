An easy way to create desktop app shortcuts in GNOME

## Overview
This simple extension tries to make easier the GNOME process to create a desktop
shortcut for apps.

The idea is simple: instead of searching for the `.desktop` files through multiple
folders let's use the application launcher that already groups all our apps.

This extension adds a new line to the app context menu in the application launcher,
the new entry ('Add to Desktop') if clicked automatically creates a desktop shortcut
to the app.

## Dependencies
This extension needs the [Desktop Icons](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1465/desktop-icons/)
extension (or any alternative to see Desktop icons) installed and enabled to work properly,
otherwise you will not be able to see the shortcuts you are creating.

## Installation
- Download zip from the releases section
- Extract in a folder named `add-to-desktop@tommimon.github.com`
- Add the `add-to-desktop@tommimon.github.com` folder to GNOME extensions folder*
- Restart the GNOME shell**
- Open (or restart) the Extensions app (or Tweaks app)
- Enable 'Add to Desktop'
- Enjoy

\* Default folder should be `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` for manually installed extensions
if there isn't this directory, create it.

\** Hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> type `r` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, if you prefer 
you can log out instead.

## How does it work
What this extension actually do is creating on your Desktop folder a copy of the original
`.desktop` file used from the application launcher.

This approach has a downside: if your application gets updated the behaviour of the `.desktop` file may change, I
experienced app icons changing path updating, this may make your shortcut no more
working properly, and you have to create a new one from zero.

Future version may include methods to fix broken shortcuts easier.
